Bare minimum media server!

Fast, small, cross-platform, and portable. Run it, point it to your movies/TV shows/music and hit the scan button. Pick a port, click "start server", point your browser at it, job done. Sure, it's not pretty, it's not smart, but it does what it needs to.

Currently in a very early state, but I am trying to balance the line between keeping it lightweight and simple and making it useful, so at present these are the only planned additional features:
* Better metadata editing (particularly for TV shows)
* Automatic thumbnail generation/album art extraction/etc.
* Improved "filename to title" sanitising/parsing for things with missing metadata
* Layout improvements

Beyond that, it's pretty much "feature complete" and only needs bugfixes. It's never going to fetch metadata from online sources, it's never going to have user management, it's never going to have transcoding, it's never going to have a *lot* of "standard" features. IF you want those then there are plenty of options out there!
